Building a tab directive:
========================

	* A directive is a way of defining custom HTML elements that use JS to create custom behaviours.

	* 2 types:

		elements
		attributes(decorators)

	* Elements contain their own custom templates and have their own HTML elements.
	* attributes are used on existing HTML elements to add new behaviours such as onclick functionality.
	* 
	The Anatomy of a Directive:


	Directive are declared using the .directvie()
	First param is the name of the directive specified in camelCase
	Second param is a function that returns a Directive definition object.

	Properites of DDO specify various config options for the directive.

	Transclude means to include one document inside another.

	bindToController = any values passed into the directives scope is automatically accessible inside the directives controller using this.
